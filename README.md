# early-forect-fire-prediction-system-COMPUTER-NETWORKS

Wireless sensor network (WSN), is a collection of
 sensors that is used for monitoring the activities in a given
 environment. They are used in the forests for fire detection where
 a large number of sensor nodes are placed to detect the fire in
 its early stages. Forest fires are the main reason which affect
 the wildlife and many living creatures. The project performs
 a comparative analysis between the traditional system and the
 new system developed used to predict forest fires early using the
 Wireless sensor network for detecting forest fires with the goal of
 monitoring the scale and intensity of the wildfire ignited at forests.
 The solution involves deploying the fire sensing sensors across the
 forest area, calculating Fire Whether Index (FWI) of the regions,
 establishing data communications between the sensors using the
 protocol to create dynamic routing paths across the Wireless
 Sensor Network [7]. These paths are developed based on several
 factors such as fire, energy, weather index and security. Tracing
 the multi dynamic route is established using star topology where
 the red alert zones send the alert message to all the nearby
 base stations. Using Net Logo simulator this project analyses the
 performance of the traditional systems and new systems based
 on network power, fire detection efficacy and the overall power
 consumed by the fires alerting systems.
